# Salita
Today at Apple Creative Studios NYC - Social Impact App Prototype

As a first-generation Filipino-American who desired to connect back to her roots, I questioned why English is one of the Philippines' national languages, and the fact that all Filipino dialects use the Latin alphabet. 

The Philippines were colonized for much of its recent history. This dates back to Spanish colonization in the 15th century which lasted for roughly 250 years. Soon after, Americans came to colonize the country for ~50 years, and Japan for 4. These long periods of colonization have contributed to a weakened sense of cultural identity among Filipinos across the country, as well as among those who live overseas such as myself.

Despite how much these colonizers have tried to erase such vital part of the Filipino identity, the Philippines is still rich in culture. The country has ~180 languages still being spoken around the country and 16 pre-colonial writing systems. Yet, there are 4 languages that are already extinct, along with only 3 pre-colonial writing systems still in use today--primarily in isolated indigenous communities.

With this, having been given the opportunity to work on a social impact app prototype by Today at Apple's Creative Studios program, I developed an app prototype and case study through Figma and Keynote, respectively, over the course of 4 weeks.

My app Salita aims to educate people, regardless of their background, about the traditional writing systems of the Philippines that have been lost in obscurity. Through four main functionalities: community crowdsourcing, an archive of the traditional writing system's characters, exposure practice via communicating with others and independent daily exercises, and a way for people to learn about the history and culture behind the regions where these writing systems originated from.

NOTE: Case study has limited information due to the 3-minute time limit alotted for delivering pitches.
